{% newthought 'Everyone at Brown' %} has a spreadsheet. *Spreadsheet?* You ask. *What kind of spreadsheet?* A course spreadsheet. With the Open Curriculum, students here concoct weird and wacky courseloads for themselves, and we need a way to keep track of concentration{% sidenote 'major' 'What we call a major' %} requirements. <!--more--> The basic solution is the best, and so the simple spreadsheet solves all of our problems. 

My spreadsheet consists of my semesterly plan, as well as a list of concentration requirements and which classes I currently have fulfilling those roles. Here is my current semesterly plan, including classes I have taken and classes I plan to take. I will only attach the course codes, so feel free to reference [C@B](https://cab.brown.edu/) for course titles and descriptions. <br><br>

<!-- Upon first glance, you might notice a few things about me. Firstly, it seems that I really love math and computer science. This is certainly the case, as may be reflected by this site. But the prevalence of the MATH, APMA, and CSCI courses I have taken highlights the other departments I have taken courses in. LATN, CLAS, MUSC, and ECON. For the uninitiated, though I'm sure you could figure it out, that's Latin, (which is a subset of) Classics, Lingustics, Music, and Economics. 

The only two economics courses I have taken are the intro course and Introduction to Game Theory, both of which felt useful to take. The Music courses I have taken are AMP, Brown's private lessons, and orchestra, for which I play the viola. Not listed was chamber music, which I did concurrently with both of these, and have done in several semesters since. The reason it disappears after my first year is due to shifting priorities, increasing workload, and that that amount of playing actually resulted in injury, from which it took several months for me to recover. Rest assured, I still do play the viola, mostly in chamber music, which I can honestly say is exactly the classical music I want to be playing at this point in my life.

Now, we reach linguistics. I have taken two courses, introductory linguistics, and Information Theory in Language, a seminar-type literature review course discussing information-theoretic pressures on language production. Linguistics has been fascinating to me for quite some time, and I am  -->

At some point, I plan to delve into some of what I have taken personally. For now, however, we focus directly on the MATH, APMA, and CSCI. <br><br>

While I could hardly say that I regret taking any of these courses, there is certainly much to be desired in the order I took these courses, and there are certainly some course variants I wish I had taken over others. A quick list:
+ **MATH 0350** as a course really just doesn't... work. It tries to be rigorous, but so much of the rigor requires some real analysis that it ends up being something like "we can't say that we can swap the order of integration for any given function, we need to show that Fubini's Theorem holds. When does Fubini's Theorem hold? Haha, that's a great question, and it's outside the scope of this class." Just take 0180 or 0200, and then take Real Analysis later if you're hung up on not knowing what Fubini's Theorem is.
+ **CSCI 0150** (cs15) is a great class, and I do not regret taking it as my introduction to computer science. However, I do wish that I had taken CSCI 0170 (cs17) intead. Given the type of person I am and the type of coding that I will be doing, I do feel that it would have been a slightly better introduction for me. Though, as Andy van Dam nears retirement, I do believe that cs15 will not be offered anymore.
+ **CSCI 1420** requires a much stronger mathematical background than is assumed by the class, and to some degree this is understandable, as it is a CSCI course and not an APMA course, but it involves a great deal of probability and information theory that is not learned in APMA 1650.
+ Speaking of information theory, I should not have waited until senior year to take **APMA 1710**. Frankly, it should be taken right after APMA 1650. Having not taken it, information theory shows up in just so many different places that it really feels important to have an intuitive grasp of it, and while I have definitely learned content from information theory before and am confident that I can apply it, I don't really have as good of an intuition around it as I would like.

With all this, I propose a do-over, with a few particular caveats. I am assuming...

... that someone has the same exact prob/stat/ML interests that I do, except in upcoming semesters, vith various upcoming requirements. <br>
... someone has as many alternate interests as I do and wishes to take at least one every semester, but usually takes 2-3, sometimes 4 courses in MATH/APMA/CSCI. <br>
... that this someone is willing to take five courses in a semester, and difficult ones at that. <br>

With that out of the way, I present **The Optimal Prob/Stat/ML APMA-CS Spreadsheet:**<br><br>

| Sem 1      | Sem 2      | Sem 3      | Sem 4      | Sem 5      | Sem 6      | Sem 7      | Sem 8      |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| MATH 0180  | MATH 1010  | APMA 1710  | APMA 1200  | APMA 1690  | APMA 1740  | APMA 2110  | APMA 1930W |
| MATH 0540  | APMA 1655  | APMA 0365  | APMA 1660  | CSCI 1010  | CSCI 1520  | APMA 2630  | APMA 2640  |
| CSCI 0170  | APMA 0355  | CSCI 0410  | CSCI 1420  | DATA 1030  |            |            |            |
|            | CSCI 0200  | CSCI 0300  | CSCI 1470  |            |            |            |            |

Let me discuss the rationale behind some of these choices.

- As previously discussed, replace MATH 0350 with **MATH 0180** and CSCI 0150 with **CSCI 0170**.
- I am abivalent between APMA 1650 and APMA 1655 when I had the opportunity to choose, as my section of 1650 covered slightly more content, such as MLE. However, **APMA 1655** is the new requirement.
- Likewise, **APMA 0355** and **APMA 0365** are new prerequisites, as is $$CSCI 0410$$.
- **APMA 1710** early will provide quite a bit of motivation for categorical cross-entropy, which made no sense to me as a term when it showed up in CSCI 1420 and CSCI 1470.
- The pathway of **APMA 1200** -> **APMA 1690** -> **APMA 1740** makes a lot of sense to me. APMA 1200 builds up Markov chains, 1690 provides some necessary review and a major application of Markov chains, while introducing Gibbs sampling, which then gets expanded on in 1740, along with a number of other statistical methods.
- I did not take **APMA 1660**, and I have no plans to do so, as I think there were more intersting courses to take, and most of 1660's content can be learned independently. This is still probably true, but because I am not considering other courses offered in a given semester, I have included it on this list.
- As much as I would love APMA 1740 to precede CSCI 1420, it simply does not make sense to hold off on 1420 for so long. But a significant portion of the math required can be intuited in 1420 with an understanding of APMA 1710.
- **APMA 2110** is a corequisite of **APMA 2630**. While the graduate probability courses have somewhat standardized curricula nationwide, if a given person has the opportunity to take it, they should. The altneratives include various graduate-level CSCI courses, which is what I plan to do instead. But from an APMA-perspective, I would contend that this is a better option.
- **CSCI 1010** should precede **CSCI 1520**, as knowing about time complexity and NP-hard problems becomes helpful when learning how some algorithms in practice can achieve better results. Additionally taking two topics at the same time in 1520 and **APMA 1740** also makes sense to me.
- **DATA 1030** after **CSCI 1420** makes sense, as after you learn the machine learning methods and mathematics, you learn how to use them in a practical setting.
- Some people consider **APMA 1690** to be a continuation of **APMA 1660**. In that case, it is worthwhile to be taking 1690 immediately after 1660.
- **MATH 1010** is good to have before attempting **APMA 2110.** While the amount of time passing in between is not desirable, it is good to have some basic real analysis before attempting some higher level courses, and will ultimately be kept fresh by the time senior year arrives.
- Certainly, many of the remaining slots can be filled with MATH, APMA, or CSCI courses as well as courses outside of these departments. I omitted **APMA 1360, CSCI 1570,** and **MATH 1530** intentionally, as even though I believe that they are important to have, they are not necessary for this pipeline. And of course, all remaining classes can be filled with courses outside the mathematical sphere! Utilize the Open Curriculum to its fullest extent!

If I could go back to 2022 and take these courses again, I think I would design a schedule as close to this as I could get. But my road was fogged by the now-cancelled Concurrent Masters program requirements, as well my then-lack of knowledge on what was useful to have until after taking it. But this is just what I would do, you should feel free to take what you want from this and modify it as will! Don't let me tell you what to do. The Open Curriculum is your oyster!
