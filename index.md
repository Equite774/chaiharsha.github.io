# Ahoy there!

My name is Chai Harsha, a rising senior studying **Applied Mathematics** (and, technically, Computer Science) at **Brown University**. Broadly speaking, I am interested in analysis, probability, statistics, and machine learning.

Previously, I have worked for the [Center for Computation and Visualization](https://ccv.brown.edu/) at Brown University as a data science intern, as well as [The MITRE Corporation](https://www.mitre.org/) as a software engineering intern. Currently, I have returned to MITRE as a machine learning intern, where I am training an LLM. 

I also do research! I am a member of the Cobb Lab, where I conduct data analysis and create visualizations in the Red Sea area. [See my work here.](https://github.com/Equite774/CobbLab) In the fall, I will also be joining the [Serre Lab](https://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/).

On this website, you may find a brief description of my projects and classworks, posts about my interests $$(\in\{\text{math, [classical/folk] music, transit,}\ldots\})$$, my experiences at Brown University, etc.

## Contact

If for some reason you are looking to contact me, send me a message on LinkedIn. If it is high priority, send me an email at $$\texttt{chaitanya [underscore] harsha [at] brown [dot] edu}.$$

## Website

This site is hosted using GitHub Pages, using the [Tufte-Jekyll template](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll) by Clay Harmon. As I become more comfortable with webdev, this site will increasingly diverge from its source.
